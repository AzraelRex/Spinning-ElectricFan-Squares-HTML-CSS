# Spinning-ElectricFan-Squares-HTML-By-Azrael-Anacleto
This is a html, css website code design that when launched displays a blue, violet, pink, and green spinning squares, containing a yellow square in the middle of it.

This is my HTML, CSS website code design that when launched displays five squares.
This is apart of my HTML mini projects series, which the first one being the solar system HTML design that I previously open sourced here on my Github profile

Now here's the quick story on why I chose the colors above in proper order. My favorite color has always been Blue closely followed up by violet, then pink and finally green.
This website code design functions in a way that the squares will first start spinning in the middle of the browser with a height of 100 closely resembling a fan and it's blades, then the blades and the blade shank will start spinning and spinning till they get smaller and smaller into the far distance where they are barely seen by the naked human eye; afterwards they will return to their original size before the whole process eventually loops yet again.
As for why Yellow is the middle and most important part of the fan, my reasoning for that is because recently I been using Yellow more and more than I used to for my everyday coloring and programming tasks, it eventually grew on me; furthermore it might even replace Blue in the future for my favorite color of all time.

If you want to download or improve upon this open source HTML and CSS website code design. Then feel free to do so.
Here are two simple steps to follow.

Step 1: First download or fork the "Squares Anacleto.HTML file" attached to this repository either use git or download it as zip if you're not well versed in Git, addittionally you can also open it in github desktop, but I've never tried that before so see for yourself what happens afterwards.
Step 2: Now that you have downloaded it  as a zip file, pork, or cloned the repository, then simply either extract it to get the HTML file if you used the zip option, if you didn't then go ahead and right click on it and open it with your desired IDE. I personally used Visual Studio Code in making this short project. I hoped it brought you as much joy and fun that it did for me when I made it.


If you want to fork or improve this code repository then please don't forget to give credits to me first. Okay. Understood?

Happy developing my fellow self taught Devs, be wary of bugs and quash them with your coffee and iron spirit. Have a great day ahead everyone. See yah next time!!, Azrael Rex Anacleto out.
